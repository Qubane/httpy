        <h1> About me </h1>
        <p> My username is Qubane, and I am 19 y/o. </p>
        <p> I mostly focus on programming related projects but sometimes attempt to do 3D modeling, generic art, <br>
            pyrotechnics and some other DIY projects whenever I can. </p>
        <p> Programming wise I code whatever really interests me, or what is actually needed to be done. <br>
            Here are some of the projects I work on: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://github.com/Qubane/HTTPy" target="_blank">HTTPy</a> - the page you are currently seeing </li>
            <li> <a href="https://github.com/Qubane/DayBreak" target="_blank">DayBreak</a> - QoL / generic discord bot for the servers I own / moderate </li>
            <li> <a href="https://github.com/Qubane/Q-Compiler" target="_blank">Q-Compiler</a> & <a href="https://github.com/Qubane/Q-Emulator" target="_blank">Q-Emulator</a> - compiler and emulator for CPU architecture I designed </li>
<!--                <li> <a href="https://github.com/Qubane/headless-discord">headless-discord</a> - headless discord project </li>-->
        </ul>
        <p> As you can see, there are a few, but there are a bunch of other tiny projects that I didn't include here </p>

        <h1> About HTTPy </h1>
        <p> This webserver was created using Python from scratch. </p>
        <p> The main goal of this server is to use minimal amount of additional dependencies, <br>
            and to overall be a fairly small HTTP page server </p>
        <p> I decided to make this server, cuz I thought it would be very funny to do so, <br>
            especially after I saw how easy it actually is in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GBlCinu9yg" target="_blank">Computerphile episode</a></p>
