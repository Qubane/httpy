title:The addition of SSL
description:Now this page works using HTTPS, very secure!!! Your bank details will be safe :)

# What is this
Finally, I added certificates to the site using Let's Encrypt and CertBot!  
So now, the traffic to the page is encrypted using ssl/tls, and if in the future any sensitive data will be shared  
It won't be affected by MITM attacks. Don't know about 10k other kinds of attacks, but you know :D
