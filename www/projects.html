            <p> My first big Ray Tracing project in Scratch! </p>
            <p> Originally I was intending on creating a small survival game out of this, but I got tired of this project, and wanted to redo the whole thing </p>
            <p> Can't tell exactly how long this project took, as there is no GitHub for scratch, but probably a couple of weeks to around a month</p>

            <p> This is the Ray Tracing project that I am more or less proud of </p>
            <p> The code is still quite terrible, but at least the end product is quite good-looking (for scratch at least) </p>
            <p> This project took probably 3-4 weeks to make, and the most amount of time was taken by physics, and even now it still doesn't really work </p>
            <p> I am planning on creating a better version of this project, but for now that's that </p>

            <p> This is really a series of projects (in scratch), and it's a tutorial series on YT where I show how to make a good ray casting engine </p>
            <p> I say good, but really it's just different, and better (performance and quality wise) than most ray casters I saw on Scratch, which rely on [is touching sprite] method </p>
            <p> This project uses DDA algorith for casting a ray, DDA uses 2 distances for both X and Y, and uses those to make a step. Check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbSee-XM7WA" target="_blank">this video</a> for a better explanation </p>
            <p> If you want to see the videos check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdbScJdEcKs&list=PL1SmCpjGwYJPyfw6ZEpeawcb6CCzE8RrD" target="_blank">this playlist</a>, unfortunately it's only in russian</p>
