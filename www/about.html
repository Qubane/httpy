            <p> This page exists because I wanted to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> First - learn how to write own simple HTTP server using python and standard libs </li>
                <li> Second - finally create a page for myself, where I can share my projects without filesize limit and such </li>
                <li> Third - I am interested on how safe my code and my safety practices are, so try to hack the page, and report on how you did it </li>
            </ul>
